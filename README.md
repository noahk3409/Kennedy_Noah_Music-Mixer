# Kennedy_Noah_Music-Mixer
This is my music-mixer project for MMED-1055-(01)-23S.

The goal of this project is to design and build a multimedia application using motion tools, design tools, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Creating a drag and drop functionality to load audio clips
and create a dynamic audio experience, trigger animation, and play a compiled audio track.
